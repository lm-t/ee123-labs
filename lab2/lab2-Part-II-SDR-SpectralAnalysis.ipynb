    "\n",
    "The rtl-sdr usb dongles enables you to obtain samples from the electromagnetic spectrum around you. In very general terms, the dongle contains several components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The antenna couples to received electromagnetic fields and tiny currents are produced in it. \n",
    "2. A tuner integrated circuit amplifies the signal, filters it, demodulates it to an intermediate frequency where it is filtered again. The dongles we distributed in class contain either the Refael Micro 820T (Black dongles) tuner or the Elonics E4000  (white dongles). \n",
    "3. All dongles are equipped with the realtek RTL2832U (hence rtl-sdr). Although the chip is capable of doing many things (like decoding TV in Europe), we use only its analog to digital converters and its USB interface.  The RTL2832U samples the signal that is coming from the tuner and spits out samples to the computer through the USB interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SDR returns samples at a desired rate up to 2.4MS/s (sometimes 3.5MS/s) of a part of the spectrum around a desired center frequency. For example, setting a center frequency $f_0 = 88.5\\cdot 10^6$ and a sampling rate of $Fs=2\\cdot 10^6$ will result in a complex valued sequence $x[n]$ whos DTFT corresponds to the physical frequency range of $87.5\\cdot 10^6 < f < 89.5\\cdot 10^6$. In other words, the digital frequency $\\omega=0$ of $X(e^{j\\omega})$, the DTFT of $x[n]$, will correspond to the physical frequency $88.5$MHz. The digital frequency $\\omega=\\pi$ will correspond to $89.5$MHz and $\\omega=-\\pi$ will correspond to $87.5$MHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q) How come the sequence $x[n]$ is complex valued ??? \n",
    "\n",
    "A) Consider the case when there is a transmitter which outputs a pure frequency at 89MHz. We choose a center frequency of 88.5MHz and sampling rate of 2MHz. The spectrum of $x[n]$ will not be symmetric, and has to be complex valued! The received signal would be $x[n] = e^{i2\\pi500000/2000000n} = e^{i\\pi/2n}$ which will have a single frequency at $\\omega=\\pi/2$ --> corresponding to 89MHz. \n",

    "To learn about what you can do with SDR's, I  recommend you watch this youtube video. Most (not all) the stuff shown there can be done using rtl-sdr. At minute 5:00 you will see an example of ADS-B, which you will partly implement in this lab. (You will need internet connection to watch the video-- so it might not show up if you are connected to the raspberryPi via managed or ad-hoc)"
