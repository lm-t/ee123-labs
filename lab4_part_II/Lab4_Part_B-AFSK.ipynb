    "# Lab 4 Part II: Digital Communication with Audio Frequency Shift Keying (AFSK)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lab we are going to experiment with digital modulation and communication. Network Communication systems have layered architecture. The bottom layer is the physical which implements the modulation. In this lab we will experiment Audio-Frequency-Shift-Keying [AFSK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying), which is a form of Binary-Frequency-Shift-Keying (BFSK) in the audio range (hence the 'A').  In the lab we will implement a modulator/demodulator for AFSK.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II of the lab we will leverage [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html), which is an amateur-radio data-link layer protocol. [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html) is a packet based protocol that will help us transmit data using packets. It implements basic synchronization, addressing, data encapsulation and some error detection.  In the ham world, an implementation of AFSK and [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html)  together is also called a [TNC ( Terminal Node Controller )](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller). In the past TNC's were separate boxes that hams used to attach to their radios to communicate with packet-based-communication. Today, it is easy to implement TNC's in software using the computer's soundcard.... as you will see here! \n",

    "AFSK1200 encodes digital binary data at a data-rate of 1200b/s. It uses the frequencies 1200Hz and 2200Hz ( center frequency of $1700$Hz $\\pm 500$ Hz) to encode the '0's and '1's (also known as space and mark) bits.  Even though it has a relatively low bit-rate it is still the dominant standard for amateure packet radio over VHF. It is a common physical layer for the AX.25 packet protocol and hence a physical layer for the  Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS),  which we will describe later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact analytic frequency spectrum of a general FSK signal is difficult to obtain. But, when the mark and space frequency difference $\\Delta f$ is much larger than the bit-rate, $B$,  then the bandwidth of FSK is approximately $2\\Delta f + B$. This is not exactly the case for AFSK1200 where the spacing between the frequencies is 1000Hz and the bit-rate is 1200 baud.\n",

    "Note, that for the (poor) choice of 1200/2200Hz for frequencies, a synchronous phase (starting each bit with the same phase) is not going to be continuous because at 1200 bit rate the 2200Hz tone is not completing full two cycles (a choice of 2400 would have been ideal!... but this is the standard we are forced to use for compatability with other systems). For the Bandwidth to be narrow, it is important that the phase in the modulated signal is continuous. Any discontinuity in the phase will result in high frequency. For this reason, AFSK1200 has to be generated in the following way:\n",
    "$$ s(t) = cos\\left(2\\pi f_c t + 2\\pi \\Delta f \\int_{-\\infty}^t m(\\tau)d\\tau \\right),$$\n",

Such $m(t)$ signal is called an Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) signal in the digital communication jargon.  Here's a link to some [notes](http://www.dip.ee.uct.ac.za/~nicolls/lectures/eee482f/13_fsk_2up.pdf) provided by Fred Nicolls from the university of Cape Town.\n",
    "\n",

    "AFSK is a form of digital frequency modulation. As such, it can be demodulated like FM. However, this is not the best way to compute it in practice. For example, any tone interference between the mark and space frequency will break the demodulation.  \n",

    "Because AFSK alternates between two frequencies, we can place two bandpass filters around the frequency of the Mark and Space and use envelope detection to determine which frequency is active in a bit period. This is called a non-coherent AFSK demodulation, because the receiver phase does not need to be synced to the transmitter phase in order to demodulate the signal. The implementation we will use here is loosely based on on the one by Sivan Toledo (4X6IZ), a CS faculty in Tel-Aviv university who has written a nice article on a high-performance AX.25 modem, and also loosly based DireWolf, a multi-platform software TNC. You can find Sivan's article [Here](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/Bib/Pubs/QEX-JulAug-2012.pdf), and Direwolf GitHub link [Here](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf). \n",

    "As mentioned in the article, it is recommended to bandpass filter before processing  (900-2500Hz). This filter has no theoretical benefit for the case of random gaussian noise. But it still has some advantages when the noise and interferences are non-gaussian. We will not do it now, but will implement this later when we implement our modem.\n",

Have the filter be the same length you used for the mark and spaces, only for its cuttoff frequency, set it to 1200*1.2 Hz. This is a balance between noise rejection and keeping the signal and helps a bit with detection in noise. \n",

    "Well... the answer is complicated. There's theory and practice. From a theory point of view, we choose the right bandwidths and signal lengths. From a practical point of view, parameters can be tuned by testing performance over simulations and real-life experiments. For example, WA8IMF created a test CD for testing AFSK1200 modems. He recorded many minutes of APRS traffic in LA. Hardware TNC can usually decode 500-600 packets on these test CD's whereas optimized software TNCs can detect over 1000.

    "### Timing Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important part of digital demodulation is the synchronization between the transmitter and receiver. We would like to sample the NRZ signal at the peak, which happens in the middle of the bit interval. However, we don't necessarily know when the transmitter starts sending the bits. There could also be some offset with the bit-rate between the transmitter and receiver due to the different clocks in the systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to do this. For example, if there's a known preamble sequence we could look for, we can perform a match filtering with the known sequence to find the bit rate and synchronize to its start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use a simple, yet elegant solution, that was implemented in DireWolf, which uses a counter based phased-lock-loop (PLL). Here's a system diagram for the timing recovery (D is a sample delay):\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee123/sp16/lab/lab5/PLL.png\" alt=\"PLL\" style=\"width: 550px;\"/></center>\n",
    "<center>Figure 4: Timing Recovery</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple. For each incoming sample we advance a 32bit signed counter by $2^{32}/(f_s/baud)$. The counter will overflow exactly every $fs/baud$ samples, which is the number of bits per symbol. When overflow happens, we record the sign of the NRZ signal and output it. If the counter is synchronized to the NRZ signal, whenever there's a zero-crossing of the NRZ signal due to bit-sign change there also should be a zero-crossing of the counter and the counter should overflow in the middle of a symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to synchronize the PLL counter to the NRZ signal, whenever the NRZ signal has a zero-crossing, we will \"nudge\" the counter by multiplying it with $0<a<1$ to get it closer to zero. When the PLL is locked, the zero-crossings would match and the \"nudging\" would do nothing. When the PLL is not locked, then \"nudging\" would move the counter towards the right offset. This solution relies on the data not to have long sequences of the same bit value! As we will see later, APRS (and its underliying protocol AX.25) solved this by injecting bit transitions in a process called \"bit stuffing\". Also, before each packet, it is common to send a string of alternating values for helping receiver synchronization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $a$ is of course a tradeoff. When $a$ is small, the PLL will lock fast, but would be sensitive to jitter due to noise. In that case, whenever the NRZ signal would have a zero-crossing the PLL would nudge a lot, and therefore be sensitive to noise as well.  When $a$ is closer to 1, the PLL will have less jitter, but would take more time to lock.  A value of $a=0.75$ seems to work well, to balance these two. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 9:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `idx = PLL(NRZa, a, fs = fs, baud=baud)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function should take as input a segment of an \"analog\" NRZ sequence, the \"nudge\" factor $a$, the sampling rate and the baud rate. It should return the indexes corresponding to the middle sampling points of symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python types don't allow for overflow, so when incrementing the counter, cast it to `int32`, to force overflow. "
