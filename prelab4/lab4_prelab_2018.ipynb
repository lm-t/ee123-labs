    "# 2018 Lab 4 prelab. Introduction to Digital Communications\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pre-lab you will be introduced to several modes of digital communications. We have written the solutions for you, however, you are more than welcome to download the empty notebook and implement the solutions yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analog Modulation\n",
    "In analog communications we encode continuous valued signals on top of a carrier frequency. Information can be encoded in the amplitude , for example: amplitude modulation (AM) or single sideband (SSB). It can also be encoded in the phase, for example: phase modulation or frequency modulation or encoded in both phase and amplitude. One of the issues with analog modulation is that you can never get the signal you are transmitting exactly recovered. It will always be contaminated by system imperfections, noise and other deviations. \n",
    "At the same time, analog communication offeres simple implementations as well as robustness because signals often degrade gracefully and information can still be extracted from them even with severe interferences and low signal to noise ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Digital Modulation\n",
    "In contrast, in digital communications we transmit quantaized digital data. Because the information is digital, this form of communications offers the advantage of a perfect reproduction of the transmitted signal. Much like analog communications, digital data can be encoded in many different ways using phase, amplitude and frequency. It can be encoded using a binary stream in which '0's and '1's are transmitted in each time interval. It can also be encoded with M-ary symbols, in which higher order symbols (for example 4-ary 0,1,2,3) are transmitted in each time interval. \n",

For example, we could use sinc based pulses that would result in bandlimited spectrum. Of course it is not practical to use a sinc, since it is infinite in length. Instead we can use a truncated (windowed) sinc pulses with certain time bandwidth (TBW) product that would have a finite length as well as narrow bandness. While here we use a windowed sinc function as we learned in class, in the communications community the raised cosine filter is often used.

    "#### Phase-shift-keying (PSK) \n",
    "PSK encodes digital data in the phase of the signal.  For example, Binary PSK (BPSK) sends a stream of '0's and '1's by alternating the sign of the carrier in each bit period: $Real \\left \\{ e^{j\\pi M(t)}\\cos(2\\pi f_0t) \\right \\}$, where $M(t)$ is a signal of $0~or~1$ corresponding to '0's and '1's. The RDS subcarrier in FM radio is BPSK encoded. Also, [PSK31](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31) is a very popular text-to-text ham radio protocol for HF that has 31b/s rate, which matches a typical keyboard typing rate. An M-ary symbol can be transmitted by MPSK in which $M(t)$ are broken to smaller intervals. For example in 4 PSK (QPSK) 0,1,2,4 are encoded in $M(t) = \\{0~or~0.5~or~1~or~1.5\\}$. It could also be encoded in a $45^\\circ$ rotated constellation $M(t) = \\{0.25~or~0.75~or~1.25~or~1.75\\}$ \n",

We would also like the phase to be continuous for the sidelobes to decay rapidly and not interfere with nearby channels.  \n",
