    "In this part of the lab we are going to experiment with Digital modulation and communication. Network Communication systems have layered architechture. The bottom layer is the physical which implements the modulation. Here we will use your [AFSK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying) modules that you implemented in lab 4 part II. In addition, we will leverage [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html), which is an amateur-radio data-link layer protocol. [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html) is a packet based protocol that will help us transmit data using packets. It implements basic synchronization, addressing, data encapsulation and some error detection.  In the ham world, an implementation of AFSK and [AX.25](http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html)  together is also called a [TNC ( Terminal Node Controller )](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller). In the past TNC's were separate boxes that hams used to attach to their radios to communicate with packet-based-communication. Today, it is easy to implement TNC's in software using the raspberry-pi and a USB soundcard.... as you will see here! \n",

    "## AX.25 (from: http://n1vg.net/packet/ and http://www.tapr.org/pub_ax25.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go to demodulate AFSK1200 we will construct data in the form of AX.25 packets. The structure of the AX.25 packet, and in particular the flag that starts and ends a frame will help us sync to the beginning of the packet for accurate demodulation. \n",
    "The AX.25 protocol uses several measures for standartization and to improve detection and demodulation of packets. We will go over them now:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NRZI (non-return to zero inverted)\n",
    "AX.25 does not encode  NRZ '1's and '0's in the usual mark and space frequencies. Instead it uses a scheme called NRZI, or non-return to zero inverted.  NRZI encodes a '0' bit as a change from mark to space, or space to mark. A '1' is encoded as no change.  To encode an AX.25 packet we need to convert our bit sequence to an NRZI one.  For example, an original bit stream of 11011000 should be first converted to 11000101 (initial state is 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bit Stuffing\n",
    "Because a '1' is represented by no change, sending a long string of '1's would result in a constant signal. This may result in a receiver drifting out of sync with the transmitter. In order to circumvent this, the encoder performs bit stuffing before transmition by placing   a bit '0' after every fifth '1' in the the stream. The decoder does bit unstuffing and removes the extra '0's. Bit stuffing is performed before converting to NRZI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bit Order\n",
    "Bytes are sent least-significant-bit first\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flag\n",
    "A Flag field starts and ends each packet. It is a unique sequence and is used to detect the beginning and the end of packets. The flag consists of the bit sequence: 0x7E or: 01111110. The flag is an exception in which no bit stuffing is performed. Therefore it is the only place in the packet in which 6 consequitive '1's appear. In NRZI it will translate to a time interval of 7 bits between zero-corssing of the non-coherent detector output.  This means that we can use the flag sequence to uniquly detect the beginning and the end of a packet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frame Structure\n",
    "The Ax.25 protocol defines several type of frames. We will use the Un-numbered Information (UI) frame as defined in the protocol. UI frame is used for connectionless mode, where AX.25 frames are transmitted without expecting any response, and reception is not guaranteed. This is similar to UDP in concept (however UDP is a transport layer protocol).\n",
    "The  [Automatic Positioning and Reporting System (APRS)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) protocol uses UI frames. The UI frame has 9 fields of data:\n",

    "APRS is a ham packet-based system for real-time tactical digital communication for local area. APRS uses the AX.25 protocol in its core. Using APRS you can report position, status, and send messages that other hams or stations with APRS capability will be able to decode, interpret and display the information. APRS also provides means of packet repeating (Digipeters) alongside with internet terminal nodes. Some radio manufacturers saw the potential and included APRS in some of their products as well. Go to this website: https://aprs.fi  to see the APRS activity in the surrounding area that is aggregated from the internet nodes. You will see fixed stations, weather stations as well as mobile operators in your area. We will use the website to confirm that our transmitted packets were received. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequencies:\n",
    "The national APRS frequency is 144.39MHz (ch-79 on your radio with the new programming or ch-117 if you have the old programming). There is much activity and infrastracture transmitting and listenning to that frequency. The international space station also has an APRS digipeter on board operating at 145.825MHZ (ch-50 on your radio). You can also use AX.25 on any of the digital or experimental channels in the bandplan -- though you will have to coordinate if you want anybody to hear you! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### EE123 APRS frequency\n",
    "To prevent interference with others while we experiment with APRS, I have set up an APRS station in Cory hall. It will monitor the XPMTU4 channel (ch-78),  443.670MHz on your radio. It has an internet link as well. Use this frequency first, and only if it does not work out, switch to the APRS frequency 144.39 (ch-79). We will do our best to make it work. \n",
    "\n",
    "### APRS Destination, source, digipeter address, control, ID and FCS packet fields\n",
    "For APRS packets, the Destination address field is not used for routing. Instead it represents the version of the APRS software you are using. In order to be decoded by receivers in the APRS network it must start with the letters AP. We will use **`APCAL`** just for fun. \n",
    "The source address is **your call sign**. The digipeter addresses require some explenation but the fields 'WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1' will result in the packet being digipeted a maximum of 2 hops. In dense population areas like the bay area 'WIDE1-1' is often enough to get your packet to its destination. The Control and ID fields in APRS packets are fixed to \"\\x03\" and \"\\xF0\" respectively. The FCS field is the checksum field, that is used to verify the packet integrity, as defined by AX.25. The flag fields are the usual 01111110.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared for you code that generates valid bitstream of AX.25 packets from the appropriate fields as well as decode the fields from a bitstream. The code is a modification of code originally written by: Greg Albrecht W2GMD. \n",

We will go over some of the information that is needed to construct valid and useful information field messeges. There are several digipeters in the bay area that have internet terminal nodes. These implement several \"fun\" and useful services. For example, you can send a position report that would show up on a google map. You can also send a short EMAIL or an SMS test message by sending an APRS packet. In fact, we have our own APRS internet terminal node on Cory Hall!\n",
