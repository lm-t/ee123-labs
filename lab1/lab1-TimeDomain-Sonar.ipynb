    "The basic idea is very simple and is the basis of sonar and ultrasound images -- Objects reflect sound waves. If we send a pulse of sound, we will get reflection echoes of that pulse. Detecting the echos and their time-of-flight will reveal their distance from the source, based on the speed of sound in air. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we are going to implement the sonar is to generate a series of rapid pulses, and use matched filtering to detect the source and the returning echos. There are many parameters in this lab that can be tweaked to get different results. We encourage you to experiment. We enjoyed very much making the lab and played quite a bit! We hope you enjoy it too. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Instructions for other laptops:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the quallity of the sonar system is going to be highly dependent on your laptop quallity, and the position of the speakers and microphone. It is recommended that you adjust the sound settings on your system such that only the speaker that is closer to the microphone is active. For example, MacBookAirs have the microphone on the side of the computer -- so you should set adjust the audio settings to left speaker only. Also, it is recommended that the speaker volume be set to half of its maximum to avoid non-linear distortions.  \n",

    "Recall from Part I, that the with of the main lobe of the autocorrelation depends on the bandwidth of the pulse. \n",
    "For a constant frequency pulse, the bandwidth will be inversly proportional to its length. Short pulses are localized in time, and therefore we will be able to separate echoes from targets that are close. However, short pulses carry less energy (for the same amplitude) and this will reduce our signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the detection and reduce our ability to detect the targets at all. So, in summary: for constant frequency pulse, there's an inerent tradeoff between the resolution of the sonar (distinguish between close targets) and the signal to noise ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a chirp pulse, we can increase the length of the pulse while also increasing the bandwidth. This will enable us to improve our signal to noise ratio as well as keeping the resolution of our sonar (by preserving the BW).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implemetation we are going to design a pulsed sonar system in which we repeatedly send pulses and then listen to the returning echoes. The arrival time of the echos will correspond to double the time-of-flight of sound propagation from our system to the target. "
